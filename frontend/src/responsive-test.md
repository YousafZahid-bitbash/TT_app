## Recent Fix: Navigation Issue
- **Problem**: Hamburger sidebar navigation links were not closing the sidebar when clicked
- **Solution**: Added `handleNavClick` function to both `Sidebar.jsx` and `AdminSideBar.jsx` 
- **Implementation**: Added `onClick={handleNavClick}` to all navigation Link components
- **Result**: When a user clicks any navigation item on mobile/tablet, the sidebar now closes automatically

## Testing
Test the responsive behavior by:
1. Resizing browser window
2. Testing hamburger menu functionality
3. Verifying overlay behavior
4. Checking content flow on different screen sizes
5. Testing touch interactions on mobile
